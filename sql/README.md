# SQL

The scripts in this directory are used for creating and destroying the SQL database.
The setup script can be run by visiting the appropriate URL. The destroy script
may only be run through the online [MySQL portal](https://tools.stanford.edu/phpmyadmin/index.php?db=c\_cs103\_db&table=submissions)

The configuration information for the database is found in the YAML file: 
/afs/ir.stanford.edu/class/cs103/db\_config/prodconfig.yaml
The database's name and password are located in this file, and so short NEVER be 
committed in this repository. More information on the YAML configuration file
can be found [here]
